Hey! You there! 
It's been years since I've seen another outsider.
To be honest, I thought I was doomed just like the others. Being in this place too long can drive you mad.
Listen, I know you're scared, but you can get out of here. We just need to work together.
That door behind you will lead back to your world. Problem is, it's locked.
If you can manage to get three keys, it will open up and you can go home.
The keys are being guarded by powerful monsters and you won't get them without my help.
I can help you PHASE BETWEEN WORLDS.
I may not look like it, but I'm an Ouroborian.
Even though I'm flawed, I still have a connection to my homeworld...
...it's a grim reflection, but it will do.
That combined with the legacy left by A DEAR FRIEND will help us traverse this place.
Come on, let's go! I'll give you helpful tips along the way!
